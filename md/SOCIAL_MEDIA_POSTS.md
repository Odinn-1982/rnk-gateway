### Title:
**[Release] RNK Lobby - System-Agnostic Maintenance Mode Module (Works with ALL Systems!)**

### Post Body:

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to announce the release of **RNK Lobby**, a comprehensive maintenance mode module for Foundry VTT that I've been developing to solve real problems during our actual gameplay sessions.

**What is it?**
RNK Lobby is a full-screen overlay system that lets GMs prevent players from accessing the world during maintenance, session prep, or server updates. When activated, players see a beautiful animated maintenance screen while the GM continues working behind the scenes.

**Key Features:**
âœ¨ **Full-Screen Maintenance Overlay** - Professional, animated UI with smooth transitions
ðŸ”’ **Player Access Prevention** - Blocks all interactive elements (no dev console shenanigans!)
â±ï¸ **Countdown Timers** - Let players know when they can re-enter
ðŸŽ¨ **Fully Customizable** - Custom messages, backgrounds, colors, fonts, and animations
ðŸ’¾ **Appearance Presets** - Save and load your favorite themes
ðŸ“Š **Chat Monitoring** - Track what your players are saying while they wait
ðŸ—³ï¸ **Player Polls** - Quick surveys to keep them engaged
ðŸ“ˆ **Analytics** - Track lobby usage and maintenance patterns
ðŸŽ›ï¸ **One-Click Toggle** - Quick button in the sidebar for easy access
ðŸ”„ **Real-Time Sync** - All clients stay synchronized via Foundry's socket system
âŒ¨ï¸ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Press ESC to quickly toggle off
ðŸŽ® **100% System-Agnostic** - Works with D&D 5e, Pathfinder, PbtA, or ANY system!

**Why I Made This:**
My amazing players have been incredibly patient during maintenance sessions, and I wanted to create something that makes those downtime periods more professional and engaging rather than just seeing a broken world. Plus, I wanted to thank my fiancÃ©e Lisa for all her support throughout development.

**Get It:**
- ðŸ“¥ Download from the [Foundry Module Browser](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/rnk-lobby)
- ðŸ“– Full docs available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Odinn-1982/rnk-lobby)
- ðŸ“ MIT Licensed - completely free and open source
